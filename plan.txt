Idea: Chrome extension that, when visiting your own github profile, removes the contribution bar from the page
Reason: I find myself comitting small/insignificant code changes on low coding days just so I can have a green square for the day.
Features:
  - Only hides the contribution bar when visiting YOUR OWN profile
    - might have to have user either sign in with github or input their username
  - In place of the contribution bar will be a motivating message (maybe diff daily) with a tiny subtext to unhide contribution bar
    - daily quote API?
    - daily limit on amount of times you can unhide contribution bar?

Will need to play around with Chrome extension development a bit before starting fully on this, learn the basic (setup/ui/etc)

(alt idea: hide ai-slop/spam ugc content from "linkedin influencers". I hate seeing those posts on my feed)
